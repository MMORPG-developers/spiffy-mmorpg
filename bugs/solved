Issue:
Erlang gives deterministic output, even though random:seed(now()) has been
called.

Solution:
Each process in Erlang has its own random seed. These are all set
deterministically, which is useful for debugging, but introduces
determinism. To solve the problem, set the random seed separately for each
process.
