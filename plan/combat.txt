In combat, the player will target an enemy and say that s/he wants to attack,
then his/her character will auto-attack that enemy as long as it's able to
(unless the player says to stop).

This is the way that almost every MMO Greg has seen does it. Notable exceptions
include Crossfire and D&D Online. D&D Online favors instead a
first-person-shooter-style system; in Crossfire you simply move into the enemy
you want to attack. The FPS system requires graphics far beyond our abilities,
so it's out of the question. The problem with Crossfire's system is that if you
kill your enemy or they step to the side, you immediately run to the other end
of the room, which is annoying and makes no sense if you actually think about
it (it's an artifact of the controls with no reasonable in-character
justification).

Of course, in order to implement a target/auto-attack based system, we'll need
a well-thought-out set of controls to allow the player to target whom they
want. For an only-somewhat-well-thought-out set of controls to do that, see
Daimonin.
