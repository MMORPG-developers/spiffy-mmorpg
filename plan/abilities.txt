Thievery:
- Theft (from NPCs)

    - Extra damage if the monster can't see the player
- Distraction
- Trap evasion

Stealth (possibly its own skill? We could make it a subskill of thievery, but I
feel like one should be able to be stealthy without being good with traps or
stealing.)
- Can be turned on/off.
- Monsters will have varying levels of hearing, so they might detect you or not
  depending on your distance, your level of stealth, and their level. Possibly
  also the ambient light/noise level, depending on how ambitious we're feeling.
- Monsters that don't detect you will behave exactly as they would if you
  weren't there. So if there are no other players around, they'll just sit
  around doing nothing, and if there are other players around then they'll
  react to those players but not to you.
- If you attack a monster, it automatically detects you. If you attack from a
  distance with a nondirectional spell (like summon firestorm) then the monster
  doesn't know where you are but will still start flailing about trying to find
  you.
