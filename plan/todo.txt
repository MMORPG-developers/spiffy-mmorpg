A collection of things that should be dealt with at some point, but perhaps not
any time soon.



Error handling in the ServerConnection has problems. First, we should connect a
slot to the QTcpSocket's error signal so we can reemit that when any error
occurs on the QTcpSocket. Second, even though we haven't done that, we're
already getting our error messages twice; I have no idea why. Third, we
shouldn't just put the error messages in the same text field as incoming data;
we should print them to stderr. Probably we should give the ServerConnection
class a slot for "send this to stderr". Or should we have a separate logger
object?


Regarding disconnectFromHost() versus abort() in the ServerConnection class's
destructor, it'd probably be nice to have it start to close down gracefully
(disconnectFromHost()) before the destructor is called and then actually finish
in the destructor. But I'm still not sure whether we need to do better than
simply tearing it down (abort()).


According to Valgrind, we have memory leaking out of our ears.
