Fundamentally, the game will be tile-based. But that doesn't mean that everyone
has to look at the world as a flat grid from above. Other options include a
partially-rotated isometric view and (much more ambitious) a first-person or
free-rotating view with 3D models on each map cell. Neither of these two will
be possible without some sort of graphical support from the server, but we
should be able to make either of them work with basically no server-side
changes other than the addition of an appropriate set of graphical objects.

If we eventually implement either of those, the fancier graphics should be
exactly paired with the less fancy ones. In fact, the server should have a
logical set of graphical objects, with unique names it can send to the client:
for instance, this object has the appearance "monsters/orc-facing-south".
If the client doesn't already know how to display an orc facing south, then
it asks the server. For the basic client, it requests the simple square tile
for "orc facing south". But a fancier client could make a request of the same
general form, but ask instead for the isometric tile or the 3D model for
"orc facing south".

The point is, when the server tells the client the appearance of an object,
it doesn't just give a filename. It gives some sort of unique specifier that
it can turn into a filename, but that could be used just as well to refer to
any of several sets of graphics.
