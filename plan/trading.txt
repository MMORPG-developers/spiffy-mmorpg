Players should be able to trade.
Quest items should generally not be tradable.

The trading process should work as follows:
- Alice sends a trade request to Bob and waits.
- Bob confirms trade request.
    - If either Alice or Bob walks away before this stage is completed, cancel
      the requests. 
- Both players simultaneously add (or remove) items to their lists.
- When each player is ready, he or she moves to the ready state.
    - Changing the list of items offered immediately moves a player out of the
      ready state.
- When both players are in the ready state, they are given the option to
  confirm or alter the deal.
    - If either player changes items, both are taken out of the ready state.
    - In other words, if either player changes his/her list of items offered
      then both players are taken out of the "ready" state (and therefore out
      of the "committed" state as well).
- Once both players have confirmed, the trade is completed.

Players should also have the option to give items. This is very useful in
combat.
Giving items requires a confirmation from the receiver by default, but this can
be changed (for individuals, for the party, and for the general population).
