Coding conventions? What are those?

Type safety? Yay, atoms!

How do you do ... in Erlang?
 * 2-dimensional arrays
 * File I/O

There are going to be a bunch of creatures and objects (actors?) in our world
that need to be referred to in multiple places (example: in the map and in the
connection object for a player). Pointers aren't exactly something you do in
functional programming, so here's what we'll do. For each of these things,
we'll create a thread (process?) to store the state, and then we'll pass the
PID around like a pointer. Anyone who wants to know anything about the object
will simply send the thread a message saying (for example) "hey, how many hit
points you got?", or "hey, got any pick-axes?" ("go fish.").
