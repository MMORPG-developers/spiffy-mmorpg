Monsters should be varied in ways other than damage and hit points.

Monsters should never attack players who are too strong, but might attack weak
players for fun.

Monsters can take up more than one space.

At the weak end, there should be monsters like rats and goblins that any player
can kill with ease.

Dragons and other extremely powerful monsters should exist, and they should be
able to easily kill all but the most experienced adventurers.

Swarms of monsters should be able to communicate with each other and use team
AI. They should attack or retreat all at once, move damaged monsters away from
players, and heal each other when necessary. The communication should be
visible to players unless monsters are telepathic or otherwise silent, and
monsters might need to be named.
