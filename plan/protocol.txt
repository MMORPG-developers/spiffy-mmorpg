    [simultaneously]
Client: Hi, I'm a client of version ___.
Server: Hi, I'm a server of version ___.
    [er, does the client actually need to know the server's version?]

    [if version mismatch]
Server: You're too old/new. I can't handle you. Bye now.

    [login, first time]
Client: Hey, is this name taken?
Server: Nope.
[server reserves the name until that connection dies or that player logs in]
Client: Hey, I want to create a new character with this name and this password
        (encrypted, obviously)

[character creation happens]


    [login, subsequent time]
Client: Hey, is this name taken?
Server: Yes.
Client: Hey, I want to login with this name and this password
        (encrypted, obviously)
Server: Hey, that's the wrong password, you bozo!
Client: Hey, I want to login with this name and this other password
        (encrypted, obviously)
Server: Okay.





And then the server sends your inventory and surroundings and a ton of other
stuff.




    [main loop]

The two send things asynchronously, with no particular relation between the
two.
Client sends commands.
Server can send:
    You're in a completely new map
    Scroll the map in this direction
    Update square (because it's changed)
    Hide square (mark it as potentially out of date)
Client can request map, or more info about a square








For the first iteration (existentialist's nightmare),
Server can send:
    Here's the map
    Now you're at (x, y)
