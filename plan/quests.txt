Quests should be varied and interesting. There should be quests that aren't
just killing a lot of a specific creature. Also, multipart quests are a good
thing. Assuming the parts are varied and interesting.

The location of the NPC (or event) that starts each quest should be easily
accessible. Marked on minimap?

Most quests should not be repeatable, but any quest that has multiple potential
outcomes can be done more than once.

There should be a quest log detailing what has happened in each quest that has
been started, with completed quests listed separately.

Badges for completed quests might be a nice touch.
