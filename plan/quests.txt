Quests should be varied and interesting. There should be quests that aren't
just killing a lot of a specific creature. Also, multipart quests are a good
thing. Assuming the parts are varied and interesting.

The location of the NPC (or event) that starts each quest should be easily
accessible. Marked on minimap?

Most quests should not be repeatable, but any quest that has multiple potential
outcomes can be done more than once.

There should be a quest log detailing what has happened in each quest that has
been started, with completed quests listed separately. It only tells you what
people have told you, but it automatically picks up information even if the
player doesn't recognize that it's related to the quest.

Badges for completed quests might be a nice touch.

Maybe have a couple races (?) that you need to learn their language before you
can do their quests. You'd need to do a quest (or possibly buy a lesson?) to
learn the language. This shouldn't be a common thing; in general everyone
speaks common.

Maybe a quest where you start by stowing away on a boat to get someplace far
away and do a dangerous mission? Dangerous missions deep in enemy territory are
always fun.
