The world should be loosely divided into regions (not all regions are
inhabited; some are intermediate space between cities. But all have stuff in
them). Regions should be made available to the player only after they have
been populated with NPCs and quests. There should be plausible reasons for
regions to be inaccessible prior to public release.

Some races should start in different regions. Several should start in the same
place, as the races have been in contact for a long time and the cultures have
mixed. Other races should know of each other, but still live far apart. Trade
should exist between such races. Some races should be in minimal contact with
one another.

Regions should be accessible by many different means:
  - By land
      * Walking from one to another
      * Using rope to climb down mountains
      * Fighting through the dangerous mountain pass
      * Using secret knock on hollow mountain face
      * Mine cart/camel caravan
  - By sea
      * Buying/stealing/borrowing a boat
      * Stowing away in shipping containers
  - By air
      * Hiring gnomish hang-gliding service
      * Riding dragons
  - By teleportation (after completing relevant tasks)
      * Buying or (at high levels) casting a teleport spell
      * Stowing away in shipping containers
      * Jumping through portals
          - Portals in the wilderness
          - Maybe previously undiscovered
          - Some taking you to places you can't get to otherwise
          - With cool things: temple to someone unique, or unusual item at the
            end of a quest
  - Misc other ideas
      * Paying tolls, either for a particular part of the trip or for someone
        to take you all the way there
      * Human/Elven/Dwarvish cannonball for small but otherwise insurmountable
        obstacles
