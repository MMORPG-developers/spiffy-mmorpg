The world should be loosely divided into regions.
Regions should be made available to the player only after they have been
populated with NPCs and quests.
There should be plausible reasons for regions to be inaccessible prior to
public release.

Some races should start in different regions. Several should start in the same
place, as the races have been in contact for a long time and the cultures have
mixed.
Other races should know of each other, but still live far apart. Trade should
exist between such races.
Some races should be in minimal contact with one another.

Regions should be accessible by many different means:
- Walking from one to another
- Teleportation (after completing relevant tasks)
- Stowing away in shipping containers
- Using rope to climb down mountains
- Paying tolls
- Hiring gnomish hang-gliding service
- Using secret knock on hollow mountain face
- Human/Elven/Dwarvish cannonball
- Boat/Mine cart/Camel caravan
- Jumping through portals
- Riding dragons
